Title: Alumni News
Date: November 2007
Note: Illinois alumnus and Stanford University Professor <b>Gene Golub</b>,
one of the world's leading numerical analysts for the past forty years,
passed away on November 16, a victim of acute myeloid leukemia.  Golub
received all three of his degrees from Illinois, taking his PhD in 1959
under Professor <b>Abraham Taub</b>.  Golub's influence on both the
theory and practice of scientific computing was profound, both through
his vast range of technical research contributions and his professional
leadership of the entire scientific computing community nationally and
internationally.

<p>
Golub had served on the Stanford faculty since 1962, including a term
as Chair of the Computer Science Department 1981-1984 and Director of
the Scientific Computing and Computational Mathematics Program,
1988-1998.  He served as President of SIAM 1985-1987 and was founding
editor of both <i>SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing</i> and <i>SIAM
Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications</i>.  His founding of
<nobr>NA-Net</nobr> and <nobr>NA-Digest</nobr> helped unify the
worldwide numerical analysis community.

<p>
Golub was also legendary for his encouragement and mentoring of young
researchers just becoming established in the field.  Another example of
his generosity was his endowment of the <b>Paul and Cynthia Saylor</b>
Professorship in Computer Science at Illinois, in honor of his
longstanding friendship with the Saylors, as well as the Hohn-Nash
Scholarship in honor of two of his teachers at Illinois, Franz Hohn and
J. P. Nash.

<p>
Golub's many honors included membership in both the National Academy of
Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering, numerous honorary
degrees, and having his collected papers published by Oxford University
Press.  Among the nearly thirty PhD students Golub produced is
Professor <b>Michael Heath</b>, currently Interim Head of the
Department of Computer Science at Illinois.

<p>
Gene will be sorely missed by the worldwide numerical analysis
community, which owes him an enormous debt of gratitude both for his
many seminal research contributions and his generous and inspiring
leadership.
