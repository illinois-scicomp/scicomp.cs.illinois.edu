        <p class="card-text">
        Students in the <b>Scientific Computing and Numerical Analysis group</b> receive
        PhD degrees from the <a href="https://www.cs.illinois.edu">Department of Computer
          Science</a> at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

      <p>
        Are you interested in <b>numerical algorithms</b>? Topics like
        finite elements,
        multigrid solvers,
        integral equations,
        spectral element methods,
        fast algorithms,
        large-scale applications,
        or
        high-performance parallell algorithms?
      </p>

      <p>
      Students in our group pursue research in areas ranging from computation to
      mathematical theory. We collaborate closely with our colleauges in the
      numerous excellent <a href="https://www.engineering.illinois.edu">engineering
      departments</a> at Illinois, as well as with the Physical and Social Sciences.

      <h2>How To Apply:
        <span class="text-muted">Guidelines and Deadlines</span>
      </h2>

      Applicants submit their applications through the <a
        href="https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/admissions/graduate">Department
      of Computer Science</a>, which starts with an online application through the
      Graduate College.

        <li><i class="bi bi-check-square"></i>
          Mention your <b>specific interest</b> in Scientific Computing in your Statement

          lock you into working in that particular sub-area. Finding your niche
          takes time, and we understand that.

          In fact, students can switch (and have switched) to even entirely different
          groups (such as <a href="https://publish.illinois.edu/theory-cs/">theory</a>

        <span class="text-muted">Curriculum &middot Connections &middot Community</span></h2>
      <p>

      The PhD requires 64 or 96 hours of credit, depending on whether you enter with a masters or a bachelors degree.  The specific <i>Program of Study</i> (POS) is felxible, but generally our students take
      <a href="courses.html#CS450">Numerical Analysis (CS450)</a>, the <a href="courses.html#CS554">500-level courses</a> in our area, and some courses in parallel computing, theory, and engineering.  In addition, the <a href="https://cse.illinois.edu/cse-educational-programs/graduate-concentration/">Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Concentration</a> or the <a href="https://cse.illinois.edu/cse-educational-programs/dse-graduate-concentration/">Data Science and Engineering Concentration</a> is often pursued.

      <p>
      We typically have around 20 graduate students in Scientific Computing
      (check out our <a href="people.html#alumni">alumni</a> over the last
      several decades!)  Our goal is a fun and <i>positive</i> atmosphere in Scientific
      Computing to help you take classes, study for the qualifying exam, and
      collaborate on research toward your PhD.
      </p>

      <p>
      We maintain close connections with major national and international research
      centers in numerical analysis and computing.
      For example, many of our students find it useful to collaborate with scientists
      at Department of Energy national laboratories such as Lawrence Livermore,
      Argonne, Sandia, and Los Alamos.

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          Is funding is guaranteed for Ph.D students?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          If you are admitted to the PhD program, your offer will typically include
          a promise of funding for a number of years, contingent on passing exams
          and making adequate progress in your studies.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          I come from an applied mathematics/engineering/science/... background.
          Will I be at disadvantage in a computer science department?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          No, definitely not. Course prerequisites can be adapted or waived by
          instructors, and because we have such a strong scientific computing
          group, our department is used to (and likes having!) students with
          strong math backgrounds even if they have fewer CS courses.
