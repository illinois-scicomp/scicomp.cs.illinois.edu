      <h2>PhD in Computer Science @ Illinois
      in the area Scientific Computing and Numerical Analysis </h2>
      <p>
      Are you interested in numerical algorithms?  How about topics such as
      <i>finite elements</i>,
      <i>multigrid solvers</i>,
      <i>integral equations</i>,
      <i>spectral element methods</i>,
      <i>fast algorithms</i>,
      <i>large-scale applications</i>,
      or
      <i>high-performance parallell algorithms</i>?
      </p>

      <p>
      You can purse studies in scientific computing and numerical analysis in
      the <a href="http://www.cs.illinois.edu">Computer Science Department</a>
      in topics ranging from computation to mathematical theory and with
      application in Computer Science and more broadly in Engineering and the
      Physical and Social Sciences.

        <p>
        The PhD requires 64 or 96 hours of credit, depending on whether you enter with a masters or a bachelors degree.  The specific <i>Program of Study</i> (POS) is felxible, but generally our students take 
        <a href="courses.html">Numerical Analyais (CS450)</a>, the <a href="courses.html">500-level courses</a> in our area, and some courses in parallel computing, theory, and engineering.  In addition, the <a href="http://cse.illinois.edu/students/undergraduate-program/certificate-option">Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Certificate Option</a> is often pursued.
        </p>

        <p>
        We typically have around 20 graduate students in Scientific Computing
        (check out our impressive <a href="people.html">alumni</a> over the last
        several decades!)  Our goal is a fun and <i>positive</i> atmosphere in Scientific
        Computing to help you take classes, study for the <a href="">qualifying exam</a>, and
        collaborate on research toward your PhD.
        </p>

        <p>
        A great part of our program is the close connections with the national laboratories.  During the summers you'll find many of our students collaborating or visiting places such as Argonne in Chicago, Lawrence Livermore in CA, and Sandia and Los Alamos both in New Mexico.
